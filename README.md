Media Grab
========

### The Idea ###

This project is designed to automate the download and organisation of media. It can be time-consuming to search for, download and manage your media, this project combats that waste of time by promoting automation. Configure the project using a json and .env files, install it on an always-on machine like a raspberry pi, let it run with the provided cronjob and let it find all of your favourite media.
